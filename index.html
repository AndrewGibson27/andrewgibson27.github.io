        <h1>Andrew Gibson</h1>

        <p>
          I’m an Austin-based technical project manager working at <a href="https://frogslayer.com/">Frogslayer</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hold

            >Certified SAFe 5 Advanced Scrum Master (SASM)</a

          credentials.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Frogslayer, a consulting firm, I guide clients through custom software projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Schwab, I guided two teams, one of which built and maintained a
          company-wide design system. My responsibilities include backlog
          management, release coordination, capacity planning, cross-team
          dependency resolution, and meeting facilitation in a SAFe environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before Schwab, I worked as a senior front-end engineer at
          <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/">The Texas Tribune</a>, a
          nonprofit news organization focused on politics and policy. I worked
          with React, Vue and Django to build, maintain and improve in-house
          apps and sites. This included the core website and CMS,
          <a href="https://support.texastribune.org/donate">donation platform</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/texastribune/donations/tree/master/static/js/src/entry/account"
            >user portal</a
          >
          and <a href="https://github.com/texastribune/dot">pixel tracker</a>. I
          also led scrum ceremonies, helped maintain the engineering backlog and
          project managed contractor development of the Texas Tribune Festival
          <a href="https://festival.texastribune.org/">website</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before that, I was a news applications engineer at the Orlando
          Sentinel. I built interactive
          <a
            href="http://interactive.orlandosentinel.com/focus-on-force/main/index.html"
            >projects</a
          >
          (that one
          <a
            href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-focus-on-force-investigative-series-wins-ona-award-20160917-story.html"
            >won an award</a
          >),
          <a
            href="http://interactive.growthspotter.com/central-florida-development-map/"
            >maps</a
          >,
          <a href="http://guides.orlandosentinel.com/summer-camps/">databases</a
          >, graphics and quizzes. I was also the principal developer in charge
          of delivering election results to the Central Florida and the Fort
          Lauderdale areas. This effort required AWS provisioning, scraping and
          processing a variety of county data formats, and funneling the numbers
          into maps and tables. (Unfortunately, poor news archiving has rendered
          my election work unviewable.)
        </p>

        <p>
          For about two years, I was co-organizer of the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/austin-web-performance/"
            >Austin Web Performance meetup</a
          >. I’ve also helped organize a few hackathons (<a
            href="https://isoj.org/hackathon-participants-build-tools-to-measure-and-boost-trust-in-news-during-pre-isoj-event/"
            >this one</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://codehangar.io/orlando-devs-hack-florida-legislature-tabs-on-tallahassee-hackathon/"
            >this one</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve spoken at the
          <a href="https://isoj.org/speakers-2019/andrew-gibson/"
            >International Symposium for Online Journalism</a
          >
          in Austin, the National High School Journalism Convention in D.C., and
          News Xchange in Marrakesh, Morocco.
        </p>

          I’m a
